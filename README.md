> ## Authorized functions and macros
* `write (man 2 write)`
* `malloc (man 3 malloc)`
* `free (man 3 free)`
* `va_start (man 3 va_start)`
* `va_end (man 3 va_end)`
* `va_copy (man 3 va_copy)`
* `va_arg (man 3 va_arg)`

> ### Compilation
Your code will be compiled this way:
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c`
* As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a `main` function in the root directory of * * your project (you could have a test folder containing all your `tests` files including `main` functions)
* Our main files will include your main header file (`holberton.h`): `#include holberton.h`
* You might want to look at the gcc flag `-Wno-format` when testing with your `_printf` and the standard `printf`.

function that produces output according to a format.
* Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...)`;
* Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
* write output to stdout, the standard output stream
* `format` is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 `printf`
* for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
  * `c`
  * `s`
  * `%`
* You donâ€™t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
* You donâ€™t have to handle the flag characters
* You donâ€™t have to handle field width
* You donâ€™t have to handle precision
* You donâ€™t have to handle the length modifiers
### 1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't 
Handle the following conversion specifiers:

* `d`
* `i`
* You donâ€™t have to handle the flag characters
* You donâ€™t have to handle field width
* You donâ€™t have to handle precision
* You donâ€™t have to handle the length modifiers
### 2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel
Create a man page for your function.
